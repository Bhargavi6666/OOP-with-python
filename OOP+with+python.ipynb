    "* Though many computer scientists and programmers consider OOP to be a modern programming paradigm, the roots go back to 1960s. The first programming language to use objects was Simula 67. As the name implies, Simula 67 was introduced in the year 1967. A major breakthrough for object-oriented programming came with the programming language Smalltalk in the 1970s. \n",

    "\n",
    "* OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes where implementation details are hidden and the unit has a clearly defined interface.\n",
    "* OOP makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.\n",
    "* OOP provides a good framework for code libraries where supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces."

    "\n",
    "* **Class**: A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class variable**: A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data member**: A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Instance variable**: A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inheritance**: The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Instance**: An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Method**: A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Object**: A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Function overloading**: The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved."
